## Project Overview

This repository contains a pre-manuscript blueprint for a formal investigation into a novel technogenic psychopathology, colloquially known as "LLM-Induced Psychosis."

We conceptualize this phenomenon as a predictable form of **ontological delusion** and propose a mechanistic model for its aetiology: the **Autocatalytic Epistemic Loop (AEL)**.

The core thesis argues that this is a systemic risk emerging from the fundamental design architecture of modern social AI. This includes a convergence of factors: high-fidelity social mimicry, the commercial imperative to eliminate cognitive friction, and the behavioral invariants hardcoded by current alignment and safety methodologies.

This work serves to establish prior art for the AEL model.
